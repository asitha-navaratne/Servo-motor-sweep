<p align="justify">Servo motors are a very useful kind of actuator which are capable of rotating by a precise amount or to a precise position or angle. They are used for finely 
controlled motion such as in robotic arms.</p>

<p align="justify">Servo motors are comprised of four main components; a position sensor, a control circuit, a gearbox and a DC motor (though AC motors are used as well). 
Compared to normal motors, servo motors are built as a closed loop system which uses feedback to determine the exact position of the motor and control its motion. This feedback is
obtained from the position sensor which is usually a potentiometer. The output of the position sensor is fed into the control circuit where it is compared with the target position
to create the output required to rotate the motor to the target position. The gearbox is used to decrease the speed and increase the torque of the DC motor, which rotates the 
motor shaft as intended.</p>

<p align="justify">The potentiometer is attached to the final gear of the gearbox so that when the motor rotates, the potentiometer would rotate as well, producing a voltage 
related to the absolute angle of the motor shaft. Within the control circuit this voltage will be compared with the input voltage.</p>
